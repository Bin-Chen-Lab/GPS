The RCL model trains on single cell line's drug-induced gene expression data, and predicts on the same cell line for new drug-induced gene expression values.

# Step 1: Prepare your drug-induced gene expression data in your interested cell line. 
Here we provide demo data of drug-induced gene expression in the A549 cell line (extracted from LINCS L4 data), which can be downloaded: [https://chenlab-data-public.s3.amazonaws.com/GPS4Drugs_RCL/LINCS_NEW_LOW_DOSE_L4_A549.RData](https://chenlab-data-public.s3.amazonaws.com/GPS4Drugs_RCL/LINCS_NEW_LOW_DOSE_L4_A549.RData)
